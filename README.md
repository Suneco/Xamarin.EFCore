# Xamarin.Forms Entity Framework Core
This repository contains a small Xamarin.Forms example project which uses Entity Framework Core
to store data. The code in this project is as minimal as possible to show how easy it
actually is to make this work in Xamarin.

The project currently supports iOS and Android.
